# Online clothing store

## Description
This app is a simple online clothing shop. You can go to the category page by clicking propper button in the top-left corner, there you have a list of available products in this category. You can add them to the cart right away by clicking on the green round button or go to the detail page by clicking on the product image. From there you are able to select size and color of the product and also add it to the cart. The green shirt button at the top-middle navigates you to the home page. The first button in the top-right corner lets you change the currency. The second one opens up a cart preview, it also lets you change size, color and amount of the product. The "view cart" button navigates you to the cart page and the "check out" one submits your order. The cart page basically lets you do the same things as the preview of the cart.
